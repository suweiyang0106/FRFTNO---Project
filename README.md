# FRFTNO-Project
This project uses FRFT, a nonstationary random field, and several partial differential equations to prove it is better than FNO.<br />
Result:
1D(36%)/2D(21%)/3D(16%) less error than FNO.:<br />
Documents:<br />
Old FNO: FNO vanilla <br />
Improved FNO: FNO_allmode <br />
FRFT: FRFTNO fixedarch <br />
Datasets: <br />
Burger/Poisson/Wave equations <br />
